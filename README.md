# Smaller Fish

My (and my friend Dimo's) submission to the Pygame Community Summer Game Jam. A puzzle/platforming game with a variety of mechanics

This was the first time either of us worked on a game jam before, and it was dimos first time using pygame at all, so we couldn't really implement everything we planned on doing.

### CONTROLS:
WASD for movement, Space to jump, left click to shoot (only after acquiring a shrink ray gun)
